                Some of my interests include playing video games, working out, and spending time with my friends.

                I started playing video games since I was young and it's a hobby which has allowed me to disconnect from what's 
                stressful during times of need. Working out has also allowed me to channel my energy. Furthermore, spending 
                time with my friends has allowed me to become more sociable.

                As a first job, I used to work at Antonino's Original Pizza here in Windsor, and I learned a lot about myself and my
                work ethic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, I applied my interest in fitness furthermore by becoming a group fitness instructor and Movati Athletic
                (Feb 2022 - Jul 2023) and a lancer recreation group fitness instructor at the University of Windsor (May 2022 - Present).

                    My name is Edxio Kraudy and I am a fourth year student at the University of Windsor.
                    I am set to graduate in October of this year and I am excited to officially begin my
                    professional life. I have already acquired one and a half years of experience due to my
                    valuable co-op placement with Nokia, and I know this will prove to be a valuable asset 
                    during my job hunt. Overall, I have the most experience with C, Java, SQL, JavaScript, 
                    and HTML (using Bootstrap, Polymer components, DataTables, et.), however I am also versed 
                    in Python, C++, and C#. Moreover, throughout my program I have been exposed to the software 
                    engineering speciailization as well as pursuing a minor in mathematics. I am thankful regarding
                    the education choices I've made and I am striving to accomplish great milestones.
